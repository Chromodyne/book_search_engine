**Note:** This repository contains my refactored source code for a book search web application created for Challenge 21 of GA Tech's 2022 Coding Bootcamp.

## Description ##

For readers around the world, keeping track of the books they wish to read is a challenge. For many, keeping an organized list of desired reading material is a must to make sure nothing slips through the cracks. With this application, users can create an account, search for the titles of books through google books, and save the information pertaining to those books to their account to keep in mind for future reading. 

The source code for this application has been refactored to replace the standard express/mongoose based routing with Apollo and GraphQL to allow for more flexible scalability in the future.
